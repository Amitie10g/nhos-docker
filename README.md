# NiceHash OS Docker (WIP)
This is just an experiment to build a Docker image from [NiceHash OS](https://www.nicehash.com/blog/post/nicehash-os-flash-tool-user-guide). I haven't tested extensively, and most of the test won't workked yet. Use it at yoor own risk.

## Licensing
The Dockerfile and scripts included has been released into the Public domain (Unlicense). The contents inside the NiceHashOS image are subjected to the correspondient licenses.
